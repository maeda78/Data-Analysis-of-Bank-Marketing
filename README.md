DATASET SELECTION


We have selected the dataset of “Bank Marketing” from the UCI MLR (Machine Learning Repository)



PROPOSED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a customer will subscribe to a bank's term deposit. The dataset contains information about the customer's demographics, financial background, and previous marketing campaign data. The predictive model we build can help banks to identify potential customers who are more likely to subscribe to their financial services. This can enable banks to target their marketing efforts more effectively and increase their conversion rates, resulting in increased revenue and profitability. Additionally, it can also help banks optimize their resources by focusing their marketing efforts on customers who are most likely to convert, thereby reducing the cost of marketing to uninterested customers. Moreover, this predictive model can also help banks improve customer experience by providing personalized financial products and services that meet the specific needs of each customer. By analyzing customer data, banks can tailor their offerings to match each customer's financial goals and preferences, thus improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. Overall, it will determine customer subscription to a bank's term deposit can provide valuable insights and benefits for banks to enhance their marketing strategy, optimize resources, and improve customer experience.


INTRODUCTION


The banking sector is a critical part of the economy of any country. Banks play a significant role in the financial intermediation process, which involves the mobilization of savings and the allocation of credit. One of the key functions of banks is to offer various financial products and services to their customers, such as loans, credit cards, and deposit accounts. Marketing these products and services is critical to the success of the bank. In recent years, banks have started to use data mining techniques to analyze their customer data to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. 
The most important functions of banks is to manage their relationships with customers. Banks need to identify potential customers and offer them the right financial services. Banks often run marketing campaigns to promote their financial services and products to potential customers.
Data-driven marketing has become increasingly popular in the last previous years. Banks use data analytics to identify potential customers who are more likely to subscribe to their financial services. Data-driven marketing helps banks to save time and resources by focusing their marketing efforts on customers who are more likely to subscribe.
In this project, we will be using the Bank Marketing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository to build a model that can predict whether a customer will subscribe to the bank's term deposit. The objective of this project is to help the bank to identify potential customers who are more likely to subscribe and focus their marketing efforts on those customers.



BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY


Marketing campaigns are critical to the success of banks as they help to promote their products and services to potential customers. However, designing effective marketing campaigns can be challenging, especially when the target audience is large and diverse. In recent years, banks have started to use data mining techniques to analyze their customer data to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. 
The Bank Marketing dataset is one such dataset that can be used for analyzing customer behavior. The dataset contains information about a bank's marketing campaign to promote a term deposit among existing customers. The dataset includes various features such as the customer's age, job, education, marital status, whether they have credit in default, and whether they have a housing loan or a personal loan. The target variable is yes or no means that the customer will apply for subscription or not.
This dataset has been used by many banks throughout the world to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. For example, one study analyzed the impact of various marketing channels on customer response to the campaign. Another study used the dataset to develop a model to predict customer response to the campaign. The insights gained from analyzing this dataset can help banks to develop effective marketing strategies to promote their products and services. By identifying which customers are more likely to subscribe to the term deposit, banks can focus their marketing efforts on these customers, thereby increasing their chances of success.
In conclusion, the Bank Marketing dataset is a valuable resource for analyzing customer behavior and preferences. By analyzing this data, banks can gain insights into which customers are more likely to subscribe to their products and services, which can help them to develop effective marketing strategies.


DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET


The Bank Marketing dataset is a public dataset available on UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains information about a bank's marketing campaigns to promote term deposits to its customers. The dataset includes information about the bank's customers such as their age, job, education, marital status, and financial information such as whether they have credit in default, housing loans, or personal loans. The target variable is y, which is about yes or no to the bank’s term deposit by the customer.
The dataset was obtained from campaigns of a direct marketing of Portuguese banking institution from 2008 to 2010. The campaigns were conducted via phone calls to the bank's customers, where the customers were asked if they would like to subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset contains 45,211 observations and 17 variables. 
The dataset contains both categorical and numerical variables. Some variables such as job, marital, education, and contact are categorical, while others such as age, balance, duration, campaign, pdays, and previous are numerical.
This dataset is often used to develop models to predict customer behavior and preferences and to develop effective marketing strategies. The dataset has been used in numerous research studies and has helped researchers gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.



OBJECTIVES OF USING DATASET


The main objective of this model making is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to the term deposit of the bank or not. This will help the bank to identify potential customers who are more likely to subscribe, and focus their marketing efforts on those customers and also help the bank to better target their marketing campaigns and improve their overall effectiveness.




PREPROCESSING ISSUES AND SOLUTION



Before we start building the model, we need to preprocess the data to remove any noise from our bank data. Here are the steps we will take:

•	Remove Missing Values: We will remove any rows with missing values.
•	Remove Duplicates: We will remove any duplicate rows in the dataset.
•	Convert Categorical Data: We will convert the categorical data in the dataset to numerical data using one-hot encoding.




FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE (PCA)


We have applied the PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by transforming the features into a new set of uncorrelated variables that explain the maximum amount of variance in the data.



MODEL TRAINING, EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION


We will now apply Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning models on the Bank Marketing dataset and evaluate their performance.


CONCLUSION:
We applied five machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors, on the Bank Marketing dataset and evaluated their performance. Among these models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved the same highest accuracy of 90.1%. However, Random Forest has a better confusion matrix, indicating a better performance in predicting both positive and negative instances. To sum up, we can say that Random Forest is the best model for the prediction of term deposit subscription.
